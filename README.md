# Billboard-Hit-Prediction
['Hit Song Science'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hit_Song_Science) concerns with the possibility of pre-
dicting whether a song will be a hit, before its distribution

using automated means such as machine learning software.

This motivated us to dig deeper to unravel how different au-
dio features would help in predicting if a song would feature

in the Billboard Top 100 Chart and build a two way usabil-
ity model - both to the musicians composing the music and

the labels broadcasting it.The project also aligns with our

teamâ€™s vision of exploring real world applications of ma-
chine learning techniques and making them useful in com-
mon domains. We explore prediction models on data from

['MSD'](http://millionsongdataset.com/), Billboard and Spotify using ML techniques.
