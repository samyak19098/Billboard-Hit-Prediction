# Billboard-Hit-Prediction
['Hit Song Science'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hit_Song_Science) concerns with the possibility of predicting whether a song will be a hit, before its distribution using automated means such as machine learning software. This motivated us to dig deeper to unravel how different audio features would help in predicting if a song would feature in the Billboard Top 100 Chart and build a two way usability model - both to the musicians composing the music and the labels broadcasting it.The project also aligns with our teamâ€™s vision of exploring real world applications of machine learning techniques and making them useful in common domains. We explore prediction models on data from ['MSD'] (http://millionsongdataset.com/), Billboard and Spotify using ML techniques.
